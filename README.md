Simple Tetris Game

A title-matching puzzle game that makes use of tetrominoes, the four-element special case of polyominoes. The objective of the game is to manipulate these Tetriminos, by moving each one sideways (if the player feels the need) and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of ten units without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. The game ends when the stack of Tetriminos reaches the top of the playing field and no new Tetriminos are able to enter.

The game is built on Java using Java Swing libraries. The project provides some basic ideas about 2D game programming in Java.
